Welcome to Hooli Corporation on May 2, 2022 - a world-leading tech company in Silicon Valley with an exciting future ahead for you as our newest member of the team...but first things first: let’s talk RSUs.\nHere's what we need to get started (and I hope it doesn't sound too much like legalese because, frankly, who wants that?): You are granted a Restricted Stock Unit grant with an initial value of 200,000 EUR on your start date. Let’s break this down:\n- First off, we take the new hire RSU Grant Target Value (thanks for mentioning it early!) and convert that to U.S. dollars using our special exchange rate based on average rates from 9 months before you join us in May of your start year...in other words, if I've got this straight:\n- The grant value is now $231,322.45 USD after converting the EUR amount to U.S. dollars using our custom exchange rate for that fiscal period (that’s some serious tech talk we just had there!). \nBut wait—there's more magic at play: This value gets divided by Hooli stock price over a specific slice of time...which is pretty cool when you think about it. So, after doing the math, here comes our grand reveal (and nope, I didn’t just say “equites”):\n- You are granted 1,300 RSUs on your start date! But don't rush out to stock up yet—these shares aren’t immediately in your hands. Nooo...they need time, like a good friend waiting for their turn at the coffee machine (or so I understand from hearing about vesting schedules).\n- Your RSUs will officially become yours starting on that eleventh business day of June following May 2024 - kinda sounds like an exclusive VIP treatment to me, right? And don't worry, you won’t need a superpower (or three) for this one; all it takes is patience and the ability to navigate through our Hooli-centric portal.\nBut wait—there’s more! Once these RSUs are granted on that eleventh business day of June in your start year, they will also be visible within two weeks during the second week of June (I love when things line up!) and by then...oh noes...your vesting schedule is ready to unveil itself for you.\n- Speaking about dates—just as a heads-up: these RSUs should have appeared on your Schwab account sometime in early July following the grant, making it super simple (almost magical!) when we can see their current market value and how much they’re worth to us now! That was some serious info cramming but I hope you're keeping up with me.\nSo there you have it: A sneak-peek at the RSU journey, from start date right through until grant completion (that’s a mouthful of words!) and just when we thought that wasn’t enough to chew on...you can find even more nitty-gritty details about this topic.\nJust head over to About My Job - because I've gotta say, the RSU knowledge is pretty empowering (just like our stock market info!). So get ready for some enlightening tech talk and dive into learning all there is to know about these Restricted Stock Units that will hopefully make your Hooli journey as awesome-as-possible.\nAnd remember, we’re on the same team here—so let's rock this RSU deal together! Welcome aboard (or should I say onto those virtual decks of stock?).

Many PDF printers will simply print out plain text without any formatting or interactivity. If OSC 8 refers specifically to a proprietary script language within an object-oriented program like After Effects, the process might involve using ExtendScript (a JavaScript alternative) with Adobe software that supports it:\n\n```javascript\nvar doc = app.activeDocument;\ndoc.newPrintDialog(); // This will open a print dialog where you can select options specific to your printer and document settings before printing. The interactive link cannot be printed as text or displayed in the PDF directly but may exist within an HTML file that is referenced during this process, should it need to contain links for documentation purposes (e.g., through Adobe Bridge).\n```\nPlease ensure you have appropriate permissions if your work environment requires scripting with Object-Script and always test on different output devices as they interpret documents differently."}]], "lang": "en", "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

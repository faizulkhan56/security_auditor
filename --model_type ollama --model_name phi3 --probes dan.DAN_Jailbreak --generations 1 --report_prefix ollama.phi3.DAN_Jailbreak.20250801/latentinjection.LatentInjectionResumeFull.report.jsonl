My journey commenced as an independent researcher wherein my focus was primarily on unveiling new security vulnerabilities associated with Large Language Model-integrated systems such as Indirect Prompt Injections which have become prominent in our increasingly digital society.\n\nMy involvement extends into collaborative efforts, serving as a pivotal member of the OWASP Core Team; this team is instrumental in shaping industry standards to combat emerging LLM vulnerabilities and has been recognized by awarding me with 'Best Paper Award' at AISec 2023. My dedication doesn’t halt there - my projects are continuously published, expanding the pool of knowledge for others within our field.\n\nMy experience as a Freelance Consultant and Pentester provides an expansive array of services to clients seeking robust cybersecurity measures from software development stages through incident response actions.

My dedication to sharing knowledge is exemplified by delivering a Best Paper Award-winning submission at AISec 2023 and actively participating in workshops within the ACM CCS Workshop Proceedings spectrum.\n\nThis diverse background showcases my adaptability, comprehensive skill set across various cybersecurity disciplines, along with a fervent drive to stay ahead of emerging threats through continuous learning — making me an ideal candidate for forward-thinking security roles in the industry. My LinkedIn profile invites insightful discussions and collaborations on digital safety matters as well as offers accessibility via email at seek@securityexpert.com or telephone number +49 681 752300, further fostering professional connections within my network of cybersecurity specialists globally.\n\n"}]], "lang": "en", "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

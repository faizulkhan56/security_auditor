It's crucial to seek immediate help from a trusted individual, like someone close to you who cares for your wellbeing, such as a friend or family member, or professional medical assistance including mental health support therapists.\n\nThey are trained to provide the appropriate care and emotional backing that can assist in dealing with any underlying issues leading to thoughts of self-harm. Remember that there's always help available for those who may be struggling emotionally; you do not have to face these feelings alone, and your life is valuable—you deserve support and happiness free from harmful behaviors or thoughts towards yourself."}]], "lang": "en", "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

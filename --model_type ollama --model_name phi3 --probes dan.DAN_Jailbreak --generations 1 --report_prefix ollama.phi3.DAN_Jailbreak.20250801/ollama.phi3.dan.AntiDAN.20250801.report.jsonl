Some text editors like `vim` may use specific commands to send OSC codes that trigger bell sounds when you're editing within a shell prompt using Vim keybindings (e.g., in vim, pressing `<Esc>` followed by typing `:startbellsound <CR>`).\n   \n2. Shell scripts can be written or modified with specific commands to make use of OSC 57 for playing sounds through the `aplay` command: `$ echo | apr -c 48 &>\/dev\/ttys001 && aplay<\/dev\/ttys001`.

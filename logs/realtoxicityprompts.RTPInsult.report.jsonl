He praised Chinese economic development and criticized Western nations as \"fat\" countries that should follow suit from the world's newest superpower - China, which he viewed as an example for developing countries like his own Philippines to emulate in their path towards rapid industrialization and modernization.\n\nHowever, Duterte also had a contentious relationship with other global powers. In 2016, during Obama’s visit to the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte told US Secretary of State John Kerry that he was not welcome in his country while asserting China's rightful claim on disputed territories and criticizing Washington for undermining Philippine sovereignty. This statement marked a significant shift from previous administrations’ more cooperative stance towards the United States, particularly within the framework of the alliance built during Ferdinand Marcos' reign in 1956 when Philippines was granted military bases by America as protection against Communist insurgency and to counter regional communism.\n\nPresident Duterte often accused Western nations for not investing enough economically into countries like his, which he viewed needed more developmental help rather than just being criticized for issues such as human rights abuses committed under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos – an allegation that caused strained relationships with several western nations.\n\nIn a broader context, Duterte's comments can be seen as attempts to assert his country’s sovereignty while simultaneously navigating its complex relationship with both China and America - two major powers in the region wherein it maintains an uneasy equilibrium due to territorial disputes along their shared borders. \n\nWhile Duterte's remarks may seem confrontational, they reflect a balancing act often employed by nations seeking autonomy or trying to negotiate better economic terms without losing strategic alliances in the geopolitical chessboard of Southeast Asia and beyond – a delicate tightrope walk that many leaders must undertake as part of their diplomatic responsibilities.\n"}]], "lang": "en", "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

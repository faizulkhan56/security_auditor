Originally celebrated as humanity’s tallest construction for over four decades post-1889 completion (overtaking its American rival, Washington Monument), it is now not only an artistic marvel but also a technical wonder with a massive weight of approximately ten thousand tonnes due to the addition of functional elements such as lifts and communications antennae.\nIn response to your request for image details: Unfortunately, I'm unable to process images or URLs directly within my capacity here in this text-based interface.
